## Working with Translations and Internationalization

First, please, read the official Flutter documentation on it:
- https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization
- https://pub.dev/packages/intl
- https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/47011
- and about the plugin: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13666-flutter-intl

In a main project (lig) you will found 2 related directories:
 - generated (generated code by the flutter intl plugin)
 - l10n with .arb files - basically, all supported locales with all translations provided.

## USE CASES:

1. **NEW TERMS ADDING**
    - for adding new term please request the translation first
    - add a new key with translation to all .arb files manually
    - run the command `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` 
    or `flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs` depending on a context or your needs
    - in your UI element you can reach your translated term via extension `from l10n_ext.dart` like:
```dart
import 'package:trurisk_sme/common/extensions/l10n_ext.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```
    
2. **CHANGING THE TRANSLATION OF THE EXISTED TERM**
    - please request the correct translation first
    - change the translation of the existed key with the new one for each .arb file manually
    - run the command `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` 
    or `flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs` depending on a context or your needs
    - in your UI element you can reach your translated term via extension `from l10n_ext.dart`

3. **ADDING NEW SUPPORTED LOCALE**
    - go to the 'l10n' directory of the main app
    - add new locale translation file with the template 'intl_<locale code>.arb'
    - first key in this file should be pointer to the locale, e.g. '..."@@locale": "fr"...'
    - run the command `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` 
    or `flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs` depending on a context or your needs
    - in your UI element you can reach your translated term via extension `from l10n_ext.dart`

4. **CHANGING THE MAIN LOCALE**
    - change the main locale in a main project's pubspec.yaml file for 'flutter_intl' package 
    - add new (if needed) locale translation file with the template 'intl_<locale code>.arb'
    - run the command `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` 
    or `flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs` depending on a context or your needs
    - in your UI element you can reach your translated term via extension `from l10n_ext.dart`

5. **PLURALS AND TRANSLATIONS WITH ARGS:**
    - firs, read the article [https://phrase.com/blog/posts/how-to-internationalize-a-flutter-app/]
    - be aware, that in a different langs there are different plural forms present, like:
             ENG - no 'few{{howMany} few contacts}', no 'many{{howMany} contact}'
               "pluralsFrom": "{howMany,plural, =0{No contact}=1{{howMany} contact}=2{{howMany} contacts}few{{howMany}other{{howMany} other contacts}}",
               "@pluralsFrom": {
                 "description": "testing plurals",
                 "type": "text",
                 "placeholders": {
                   "howMany": {}
                 }
               },
             
             RU - no 'other{{howMany} нажатий}'' will be called
               "pluralsFrom": "{howMany,plural, =0{Без нажатий}=1{{howMany} нажатие}=2{{howMany} нажатия}few{{howMany} нажатия}many{{howMany} нажатий}other{{howMany} нажатий}}",
               "@pluralsFrom": {
                 "description": "testing plurals",
                 "type": "text",
                 "placeholders": {
                   "howMany": {}
                 }
               },

## Please be sure, that supported locale is added to the native platforms as well.
